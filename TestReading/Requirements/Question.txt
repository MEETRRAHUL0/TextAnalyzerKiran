Scenario: Text Analysis

	You have been asked to provide code to analyse small text files which you should download from blackboard.

Requirements

	You should produce a C Sharp console-based application (Console App (.NET Framework) – C#).  The application will allow a user to select a single plain text file from a list of at least 4 different files (placed in the solution folder) by entering an option when prompted in the console.

	User must then be prompted with 5 options/functionalities:
		1.	Message: Enter a word and see how many times it occurs in the file.
		2.	Message: Enter a single character and see how many times it occurs in the file.
		3.	Message: Get the number of lines in the file.
		4.	Message: Get the number of words in the file.
		5.	Message: Get the number of characters in the file.

Application functionality:
	1.	Your application must stay running while user is going through the various options.
	2.	Analysis must output disregarding the case sensitivity.

C Sharp Expertise
	1.	You should create a new class called TextAnalysis. The class should contain the methods and variables required to implement the requirements.
	2.	Your application should include the following language features as a minimum:
		a.	Typed variables
		b.	Loops
		c.	Conditions
		d.	Arrays and collections (including a Dictionary), Lists
		e.	Methods
		f.	Classes and objects
		3.	Your code should be commented and include suitable names for variables, methods etc  Your code should be readable and easy to follow.

Advanced feature
	4.	You should add an advanced feature to your application.  For example
		a.	You can identify the most frequently occurring word, the longest word
